Abstract for the Team 18

 A. How engaged my employees are?

Just as much as we focus on customer relations in business, employee trust and satisfaction is also important. How do we know what the employee is passionate about, under what circumstance they give top performance, which policies and features of the company do they like or dislike, how do we gain their trust or from a manager’s point of view how do we figure out which employee will retain in the organization, who should be promoted, why did the employee’s performance boost up or deteriorate? 
All this and much more can be done by mining data from social media data and also by using existing data of employees that has been accumulated over the years inside the organization. The data obtained from social media like posts, tweets, blogs etc. related to work, we can determine the employee’s attitude towards the company and his passion towards his work. With Big data analysis, we can not only use the data to ensure current employee performance and satisfaction but we can also use it hire new employees whose performance outcome also can be predicted without depending on the paper resume or going with gut feeling during interview process

 B. Blockchain enabled Real Estate transaction workflow

Blockchain, it is essentially an open, secure record-keeping system consisting of blocks that contain valid transactions, linked together by chains.
We can use smart contracts which can speed up the implementation and can also eliminate the dependency which in turn lower the cost of the transaction of the entire process. Use of smart contracts will also help in sharing the information and eliminate the need of the third party. Smart contracts are programmable contracts that runs on blockchain that gets active once there is any activity between the two parties satisfies without any kind of involvement of the third party.
Blockchain serves as the public history entity of transactions that can be used as a verification of the transaction existence while securing and safeguarding the identities of the stakeholders and ensures to keep the personal data safe. 
Technology used:
1.	Blockchain
2.	Bitcoin
3.	Crypto- currency techniques – Hashing, digital signature
We can preserve the confidential details and thereby preventing fraud, abuse, and manipulation of the techniques.
We can use Blockchain at four different stages where we remove the dependency of the third party to maintain the notaries, asset custodians and foster self-executable transaction.
Firstly, we can use the blockchain to eliminate the fee of transaction that we pay to the buyer and seller agents, bank or any other third party. It can help us in saving the cost and time which involves these third-party traders.
The first transaction block created in blockchain is the Genesis block which can be used to serve as the escrow account.
We can also eliminate the manual initiation process by using the blockchain for buyer to initiate the loan process with bank
Blockchain is also used to foster the negotiation for the closing procedure process.
